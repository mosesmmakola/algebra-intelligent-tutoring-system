# Algebra Intelligent Tutoring System (CSP-Based)

An AI-powered Intelligent Tutoring System designed to assist learners in solving algebra problems using Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs).
The system guides users step-by-step through problem-solving using rule-based reasoning.

This project was developed as part of an Artificial Intelligence academic project.
